##### By Ben Royans

## Instructions
* Download and open the project in Arduino.
* Alter Pin definitions as required.
* Upload to Arduino.

## Usage
#### Temperature Indicator
* The LED will be solid blue when the current temperature is equal to the minimum temperature (set on line 17).
* The LED will be solid red when the current temperature is equal to the maximum temperature (set on line 18). 
* In between values will show a corresponding value between the two colours.

#### Ideal Temperature
